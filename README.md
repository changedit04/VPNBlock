# VPNBlock

## A service which allows you to block ads with a VPN (VPN is hosted by VPNBook, I hold no responsibility for it)

Please remember that the standard ad-block will not recognise Google as an ad blocker. If you would like the VPN to recognise Google, then please use the different options specified on the page.
